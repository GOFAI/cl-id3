CL-ID3 is a library for reading id3v2.2 and 2.3 tags and writing id3v2.3
tags based on the example in chapter 25 of Peter Seibel's _Practical
Common Lisp_. I needed this for a particularly complex web scraping project
and it is only designed to do what I needed it to do-namely, rewrite .mp3
files with new id3v2.3 tags encoded in utf-8. Patches/extensions welcome.
